# BeatJus-site
# Description
Beatjus is a portfolio website designed for a videographer to display his best work. The site was created using HTML, and Css. This site links to external video sources through vimeo and allows clients to view videos, contact the website owner directly, and view all of their media accounts. 

## My Responsibility 
Durring this project I was responsible for designing and building the front end, as well as hosting the site and maintaining any issues that may arise.

## Problems encountered
The development of this site had run relatively smoothly since it is a small project but the largest problem that had occured was designing the site. With a website like this your goal is to display the work of the client as best as possible but when working with this client they did not have much content to display yet. The current design was made to be able to easily grow with the client and with minor adjustment you can make the website display large portfolios with ease.
